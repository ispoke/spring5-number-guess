# spring5-number-guess
"Guess The Number Game" was created using Spring 5 and Thymeleaf. It is part of a course I'm doing on Spring. 
It simply asks the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50. 
The UI is available in English, Irish(ga), and Spanish (apologies in advance to Spanish speakers)
